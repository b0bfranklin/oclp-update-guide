# OpenCore Legacy Patcher Update Guide for 2011 iMacs

This guide provides instructions for updating macOS on 2011 iMacs using OpenCore Legacy Patcher (OCLP) version 2.2.0+. This focuses specifically on installing system updates rather than major OS version upgrades.

## Pre-Update Checklist

- [  ] Ensure you have a recent Time Machine backup
- [  ] Check your current macOS version (Apple menu > About This Mac)
- [  ] Make sure you have admin privileges on the Mac

## Step 1: Update OpenCore Legacy Patcher

1. Download the latest OCLP (2.2.0 or newer) from: [OCLP GitHub Releases](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/releases/)
2. Download the appropriate `.dmg` file for macOS (typically "OpenCore-Patcher-GUI.app.dmg")
3. Mount the DMG and drag the application to your Applications folder

## Step 2: Backup the Current EFI

1. Open OCLP
2. Click on "Settings" and check "Create EFI backups when building OpenCore"
3. This ensures you have a fallback if anything goes wrong

## Step 3: Rebuild and Update OpenCore

1. In OCLP, click on "Build and Install OpenCore"
2. Select your iMac model (2011 iMac)
3. Click "Build OpenCore"
4. When prompted, select "Install to internal disk"

## Step 4: Apply System Updates

1. Restart your Mac
2. Go to System Preferences â†’ Software Update
3. Install all available updates
4. Your Mac will download and install the updates, then restart

## Step 5: Post-Update Patches

1. After the Mac restarts with the updates installed, open OCLP again
2. Click on "Post-Install Root Patch"
3. Select the patches needed for your hardware (typically Graphics, WiFi, Bluetooth)
4. Click "Start patching" and enter your password when prompted
5. Restart your Mac when the patching is complete

## Troubleshooting

- If your Mac doesn't boot after updating, restart while holding Option and select the OpenCore boot option
- If you still encounter issues, restart while holding Command+Option+P+R to reset NVRAM
- If all else fails, restore from your Time Machine backup
